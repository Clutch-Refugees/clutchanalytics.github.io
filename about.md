Clutch Analytics™ is the digital manufacturing arm of Windhaven™ Insurance.
This crack team is dedicated to the invention and production of technologies
that solve real customer and local agent needs in ways that break the norms and
conventions of the insurance industry.

The Clutch Analytics team recently launched the first-ever comparative auto
insurance rater that allows local independent agents to offer their site
customers the ability to compare and buy auto insurance online directly from
them.

We’re looking for A-Players that have the digital chops to manufacture stuff
that will help Windhaven Insurance continue its meteoric growth as one of the
fastest growing auto insurance carriers in the country. We consider A-Players
not only to have incredible talent, but yearn to be part of a unique culture
that is built on Core Values that actually mean something and drives how we
work and succeed.
